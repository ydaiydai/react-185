				            Using pre-built character in a single-player RPG is generally a safer choice for game developers. 
				            While it might limit the playerâ€™s level of creativity, it usually makes the game more cohesive. 
				            Unless the game strongly emphasizes its sandbox elements or has much room for a created protagonist, 
				            giving the player established characters would only lead to few criticisms if at all.
